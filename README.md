## metaCAMPUS EQ2 Decentralized Autonomous Organization
Non profits can use equity equivalent EQ2 smart contracts to enhance transparency, automate processes, and decentralize governance.

This is an innovative approach that offers a digital alternative to traditional financing models, which are legally unavailable to non profits, by providing donors and stakeholders with a verifiable on-chain record of contributions and expenditures.
