# **metaCAMPUS — Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement**

## **This Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (“Agreement”)** is entered into as of [Month Date, Year] (“Start Date”) by and between metaCAMPUS LLP, a Washington State Limited Liability Partnership organization operating as a non-profit Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) (“Company”), and [Your Organization] (“Recipient”). 

## **\1. Confidential Information
“Confidential Information” means any non-public information, including, without limitation, that which relates to technical data, know-how, research, products, services, customers, markets, inventions, processes, designs, marketing, finances, or other proprietary information that is disclosed by Discloser or its affiliates to the Recipient. Confidential Information may be disclosed in any form, whether oral, written, or visual, and may be marked as "Confidential," or if unmarked, would, under the circumstances of disclosure, be understood by a reasonable person to be confidential. If Discloser fails to identify information as “Confidential Information” at the time of disclosure it may subsequently identify the information, on a prospective basis, as “Confidential Information” by giving written notice to the Recipient. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term Confidential Information does not include information which: (i) has been published by Discloser or is otherwise in the public domain through no fault of Recipient; (ii) is properly within the legitimate possession of Recipient prior to disclosure hereunder and without any obligation of confidence to Discloser or any third party; (iii) is lawfully received by Recipient from a third party who lawfully possesses the information and who is not restricted from disclosing the Confidential Information to Recipient; (iv) is independently developed by Recipient without use of the Confidential Information; or (v) is approved for disclosure by Discloser, in writing, prior to its disclosure.

## **\2. Use of Confidential Information
Recipient may use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of Discloser’s express written purpose with Discloser and for no other purpose, including, but not limited to, any competitive purpose.

## **\3. Confidential Information and 3rd Parties
Recipient agrees not to reveal Confidential Information to any third party without Discloser’s prior written consent. Recipient shall provide the highest degree of care, to prevent disclosure or unauthorized use of Discloser’s Confidential Information. Recipient may disclose Confidential Information only to its employees or agents who have a "need to know" such information.

## **\4. Disclosure of Confidential Information to the Public
Confidential Information may be disclosed without breach of this Agreement in response to a valid order of a court of recognized jurisdiction; provided, however, that, Recipient first gives adequate notice of the relevant order to Discloser and has, as appropriate: (i) fully cooperated in Discloser’s attempt to obtain a protective order from the relevant jurisdiction, or (ii) attempted to classify the media containing the Confidential Information to prevent access by the public.

## **\5. Twenty Business Day Remedy
All Confidential Information and all copies thereof shall remain the sole property of Discloser. Upon Discloser’s written request, Recipient shall, within twenty (20) business days, either return to Discloser or, at Discloser’s option, destroy all Confidential Information and all copies thereof. Recipient shall provide a written certification of destruction to Discloser within twenty (20) days thereafter.

## **\6. ITAR Acknowledgement
Recipient acknowledges that Confidential Information may be supplied hereunder and may be subject to export controls under the laws of the United States of America. Recipient shall comply with such laws and regulations and agrees not to export, re-export or transfer Confidential Information without first obtaining all required authorization or licenses.

## **\7. Intillectual Property Retainer 
All Confidential Information and all intellectual property rights related thereto remain the sole and exclusive property of Discloser. No license or other rights to use, copy, or exploit any intellectual property or Confidential Information is granted or implied under this Agreement. Recipient agrees not to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any software, products, or prototypes provided by Discloser.

## **\8. Term of Agreement
The term of this Agreement is one (1) year starting on the Effective Date. The obligations set forth in this Agreement shall terminate one (1) year after the Effective Date. In the event that any portion of this Agreement is ruled invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining portions will continue to be valid and in effect, and interpreted as if the invalid portion has never been a part thereof.

## **\9. Amendment by Writing
This Agreement cannot be amended, nor its provisions waived, except by a writing signed by authorized representatives of both parties.

## **\10. Governing Law
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the United States of America. There are no other understandings, agreements or representations, express or implied, between the parties regarding the subject of this Agreement.
